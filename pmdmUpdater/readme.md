The update.js script uses Google's puppeteer library to load the products configuration page and update all pmdm products in the grid.

User buildDocker.sh to build the pmdmupdater docker file. Use the runPMDMUpdate.sh to launch the docker, modifying the user name and password as needed. I recommend copying the runPMDMUpdate script to a different directory and then you can fetch the latest from git and rebuild the docker without affecting your config.
